For example, we report all events that result in harm (punctures, bites lacerations). The report goes to the associates supervisor. If the event was not sever, and there is no requirement to report externally, the report will stop there. There are other circumstances where the report will go to the Biosafety Officer or to an external agency.

Some events must be reported externally, but not due to a high or low consequence agent, instead due to potential for exposure to agents through exposure to human materials (ex. needlestick and blood) or exposure to a genetically modified organism (degree of consequence unknown).	we do not work with high risk pathogens	Lab workers see incident reporting as important for their own safety	reporting procedures have been forgotten due to infrequency of events	none		I'm not sure you will be able to draw accurate conclusions from the survey, based on my experience of the questions and how the selection of potential answers did not accurately describe the situation at my institution.

At our institution, we encourage reporting of all near-misses and incidents, although anecdotally I might estimate that <<5% of near misses are reported. I believe that exposures to biological agents (select agents, or materials/activities subject to US NIH governance) are reported at a much higher percentage - perhaps >95% for select agents and >75% (just a guess) for genetic modifications.
