There are several candidates, but the best seems to have been adopted by Ben Garfinkle of FHI, with an alternative mentioned to me privately by Toby Ord.

Ben has proposed the term "Efflouresence," from a 2002 paper by Jack Goldstone, here: https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078976 
In that paper, it says:
So let me propose another term: "efflorescence," intended as the opposite of "crisis." Where a crisis is a relatively sharp, unexpected downturn in significant demographic and economic indices, often accompanied by political turmoil and cultural conflicts, an "efflorescence" is a relatively sharp, often unexpected upturn in significant demographic and economic indices, usually accompanied by political expansion and institution building and cultural synthesis and consolidation. Such "efflorescences" typically involve both Smithian and Schumpeterian growth, in a mutually reinforcing fashion. They are often seen by contemporaries or successors as "golden ages" of creativity and accomplishments. Moreover, they often set new patterns for thought, political organization, and economic life that last for many generations.

Toby suggested: "'peripeteia,' which is a literary device of a sudden reversal of fortune, either from good to bad, or bad to good. Its main failing is that it is symmetrical." He also noted that it may be that Foresight is using it somewhat differently than he does, where he intended that the "technical use was a sudden, overwhelming, rise in the EV of the longterm future," while he thinks that Foresight may have a somewhat different concept that is worth more fully explicating.
